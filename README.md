# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Women's Clothing Reviews dataset.

## Purpose of EDA
- **Understanding the Data**: EDA helps in understanding the underlying structure, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- **Identifying Anomalies**: It helps in identifying any outliers or anomalies in the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: EDA can assist in selecting the most relevant features for further analysis or modeling.
- **Assumptions Checking**: EDA allows us to check the assumptions required for further statistical analysis.

## Steps in EDA
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze each variable individually to understand its distribution and characteristics.
4. **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore the relationships between pairs of variables.
5. **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigate relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.
6. **Visualization**: Utilize graphical techniques such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to visually represent the data.

## Tools for EDA
- **Statistical Software**: Python (libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Visualization Tools**: Plotly.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab.

## Consequences of Skipping EDA
- **Model Performance**: Without a thorough understanding of the data, models may not perform optimally.
- **Biases and Assumptions**: Skipping EDA may lead to biased results or incorrect assumptions about the data.
- **Missed Insights**: Valuable insights and patterns in the data might be overlooked, leading to incomplete analysis.
- **Increased Risk**: Making decisions based on incomplete or misunderstood data can increase the risk of errors or poor outcomes.
